////constructGrid() is good but probably not good enough

////Ideally every showScreenX should be split into two specialized functions :
1 --- Event handler
2 --- Drawer

..and their base kept the same as a sort of a template
so that needed menu/additional screen can be shown through the same function. 
On the other hand, this may not be achievable due to functions requiring
completely different arguments or being implemented very differently.

////std::list was not satisfactory or even better than std::vector in any way.
At least for now.

////Resolutions need a good think-through. Currently a texture for every menu 
assumes a screen of 1920x1080 and shrinks otherwise. Game process is 
untouched for now.

////A satisfactory way of constructing and saving levels is required.

////Perhaps there should be an "editor mode" that allows object construction 
using console (or other) input and supports only basic walking/collisions to reduce
resource usage. Main issue is the compilation time though.

////Textures, textures and more textures

////Also implementation details, interaction types, weapon types, entities, other
characters, etc. etc. Maybe textures.

////Other than that the whole mess was pretty much cleaned up
